<h1><u>Insertion Sort</u></h1>
<h3><p style="text-align:justify;">Insertion sort is slightly different from the other sorting algorithms. It is based on the idea that each element in the array is consumed in each iteration to find its right position in the sorted array such that the entire array is sorted at the end of all the iterations. In other words,it compares the current element with the elements on the left-hand side (sorted array).If the current element is greater than all the elements on its left hand side, then it leaves the element in its place and moves on to the next element. Else it finds its correct position and moves it to that position by shifting all the elements, which are larger than the current element, in the sorted array to one position ahead.</p></h3>

<h3><p style="text-align:center;">Let us consider an array with 5 elements, A = [7, 1, 23, 4, 19]. Below is how insertion sort works for this array.</p></h3>
